# DataStructure
This's a workplace for myself to practice data structure.

## prj-1-SymmetricList
This is a project of symmetric list. Had been tested in both windows10-x64 and ubuntu-64. In theory it should work well in windows10-x86 and ubuntu-x86.

## prj-2-CrossList  
This is a project about cross list. There are some functions of cross list, such as insert, delete, update and select.There is a diagram of cross list as follow.
